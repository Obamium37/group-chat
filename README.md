This is a group chat I modeled off this video:

<b> It is a great Youtube tutorial on an intro to web sockets and would highly recommend it.</b>

## Project

Built a group chat in Java using sockets, and learning how to listen and write data to and from different sockets

Will build off of this project in the near future
